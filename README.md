# Photo Organizer

This is a script for organizing photos, and in my personal case, it does so on an external hard drive. Originally, I made this program for moving files in my Dropbox folder to my external hard drive. It organizes the directories with the form

    /year/month/day/

and renames the files in the form

    year-month-day hour.minute.second.fileFormat

because that's what I wanted. Perhaps you want to organize your photos the same way. If so, feel free to use this project as you please.
